# Bring your protocol to real-time application

With the growth of internet, the demands of real-time is also expanded to other areas. Web, mobile, cloud, and IoT frameworks all place strong emphasis on real time data as a means to achieve live, synchronous interaction with the world. The [Azure Web PubSub service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/web-pubsub/) helps you build real-time messaging web applications using WebSockets and the publish-subscribe pattern easily. Meanwhile, there is a new challenge coming that there are some protocols existing or already widely used in specific industry. For example, 
* [Open Charge Point Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Charge_Point_Protocol) (OCPP) is an application protocol for communication between Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and a central management system for charging station network. From 2019 the use of OCPP (or equivalent) is required for new chargepoints in the UK meeting the electric vehicle home charge Scheme requirements.
* [Message Queue Telemetry Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) (MQTT) is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting constrained devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth. The [Advanced Message Queuing Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol) (AMQP) is a software layer protocol for message-oriented middleware environments.â€¯It supports reliable verbal exchange through message transport warranty primitives like at-most-once, at least once and exactly as soon as shipping. Both of them are widely used in IoT area.
* [GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL) is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.
* [Protocol Buffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers) (Protobuf) is a free and open source cross-platform library used to serialize structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a network or for storing data. 

With the Azure Web PubSub service, you could bring your protocol to your real-time application easily. Let's walk through the video sharing demo to learn how to use Azure Web PubSub and protobuf as subprotocol together to build a binary based client pubsub solution.

## Overview of the sample

* For frontend: HTML5/javascript, bootstrap and vue.js
* For backend: node.js + express.js
* For realtime communication: Azure Web PubSub with protobuf subprotocol

## Setup the Web PubSub 

## Build and run locally

## Deploy to Azure

## Next steps
